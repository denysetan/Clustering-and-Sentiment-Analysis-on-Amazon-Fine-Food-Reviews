# Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews
Text Mining Project

Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, collects enormous amounts of data every day from
their users to generate recommendations, price optimizations and more. This results
in the difficulty to manage and digest the data collected effectively. To tackle this issue, we will be
specifically looking at the reviews of Amazon Fine Food and perform text analysis tasks to acquire
valuable trends and patterns. The target audience are the amazon users, sellers and amazon
itself. We will be performing Clustering and Sentiment Analysis on the reviews. These analysis
tasks will be useful to both customers and sellers using Amazon’s services.

Our model will be a navigation tool which will display the results retrieved after performing the
analysis tasks. These results will be in the form of categories that users can browse through. Each
category is supplemented with the top reviews and its sentiment.

Customers can make informed choices when deciding on the products to purchase as they are
able to retrieve relevant information. Whereas, sellers will be able to make improvements on their
product based on the various sentiments.
